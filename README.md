# Rsst

rsst is a terminal RSS reader written in Rust. It's a hobby project inspired by [kiro-editor](https://github.com/rhysd/kiro-editor) and [Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html). Think of it as a very tiny [newsboat](https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat) with just the bare-minimum features.

This project is a playground project and is still in solo development, but any suggestions or resources are more than welcome.
